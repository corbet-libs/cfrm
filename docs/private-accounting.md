# Private reciprocal accounting: backend decision review

> Historical prototype documentation. It does not describe the current Forum API or storage authority. See the [current contract](CONTRACT.md) and the [original research snapshot](https://github.com/corbet-libs/cfrm/blob/b4bb89c81c4d4856c8ae04da3151eb4d8104ad8d/docs/private-accounting.md).

**2026-09-15 — historical backend review and measurements; not an audit.**
Inspected cfrm `2c4fa47` and the current cmsg identity, receipt and directional
Inbox work for the initial review. The later isolated spike was executed on Crow;
no local builds or proving benchmarks were run on the workstation.
Eligibility remains an external verified input; provider selection is outside scope.

The later experimental [v2 account ledger](account-ledger.md),
[selected policy](reciprocity-policy.md) and [private peer presentations](private-reservation-protocol.md)
now implement genesis, both reservation roles, protected release, Answer/Close,
Prepared cancellation, outgoing expiry and bounded refill. The current evidence
is recorded in those documents. The earlier spike and proposed next steps below
retain their original scope; they are not the present implementation status.

## Implemented paths and production boundary

[AllocationLedger](../src/allocation.rs) conserves an aggregate named-member
allowance across devices. [Permits](../src/permits.rs) and the
[native issuer](../src/permit_issuer.rs) implement blind issuance and atomic
one-use redemption. These transferable permits do not prove which member owns
a hidden receipt, prevent credit pooling, or enforce reciprocal accounting.
`resolve_private` correctly returns `UnsupportedCapability`.

cmsg authenticates member-controlled roots, independently authorized devices,
private answer/close receipts, conversation nonces and directional block history.
These now supply witnesses for the experimental account-state and peer proofs.
A mutable client journal, even when encrypted and signed, is not by itself an
operator-verifiable balance proof.

The required budget is **one per permanent community member**, affected by both
unanswered outgoing introductions and received introductions left unanswered.
An answer or recipient-owned closure resolves the appropriate obligation under
the [selected v2 policy](reciprocity-policy.md). Sender cancellation cannot refund
an Active outgoing obligation or reset the recipient's first-message limit;
current-chain cancellation of a never-activated Prepared reservation is separate.
Established traffic and reconnection require no conversation-specific operator
call. Numerical values remain mandatory configuration. Bounded refill, explicit
outgoing expiry and no extra Answer reward are selected policy rules.

## The statement a verifier must actually check

The following is an acceptance relation, not a new cryptographic primitive.
Commitments, pseudorandom functions, signatures and proof systems must come from
reviewed implementations. `P` denotes the complete, pinned public policy.

### Public inputs and private witnesses

The smallest ledger need not hide the account performing an update: individual
membership and agreed numerical state are already permitted operator knowledge.
Keep a named account's latest hiding state commitment and authenticate every
update. Hide its contacts and the openings of that state.

| Public to cfrm | Private witness, never operator input |
| --- | --- |
| Community, policy/version digest, circuit/verifying-key digest, common eligibility checkpoint, accepted time interval | Eligibility and device/root credentials for any hidden counterpart, authenticated roster paths |
| Updating owner ID, previous accepted state commitment/version, proposed next commitment | Owner's registered accounting secret/delegation; both state openings; balance, refill frontier, pending obligations, private pair/block maps |
| Domain-separated owner-specific spent markers, independently randomized operation/retry ID | Counterpart ID, introduction nonce, group binding, receipt bytes and signatures, commitment randomness, private paths |
| Only explicitly permitted numerical outputs | Relationship between this update and the other endpoint's update |

There must be **no common pair hash, nonce, commitment, request hash or nullifier
in both named endpoints' operator requests**. Equality of such public values
would join the accounts. Owner-specific markers can stop reuse within an owner;
the proof must bind their hidden pair input. Fully anonymous state-note updates
are another route, with more genesis, recovery and ledger machinery. Zcash is
a concrete reference for commitment membership, nullifiers and value conservation,
not a drop-in social accounting implementation. [Zcash protocol](https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf)

### Required constraints

1. **Owner and eligibility.** The public owner equals the permanent
   community-scoped root-derived ID. Prove possession of its registered accounting
   authority and valid delegation, not merely knowledge of somebody's public
   credential. New reservations require a currently eligible, distinct permanent
   counterpart under the pinned common checkpoint. Later recipient-owned closure
   uses the authenticated reservation's historical peer eligibility: a silent
   peer's expired membership must not prevent the recipient resolving its own
   obligation. Verify the actual receipt signer's authority as specified below.
   An eligibility issuer's
   signature alone cannot register a replacement device/accounting key under
   an existing member root.

2. **One genesis; no recovery refill.** A root-authorized registration creates
   exactly one initial state for that member. Enforce a lifetime genesis marker
   independently of credential expiry, device count and epoch. Recovery consumes
   or resumes that same state and retains spent-pair markers and obligations.
   Changing the accounting/nullifier key requires continuity, not fresh genesis.
   Loss of all opening/recovery material has no proven balance-reset escape hatch.

3. **One successor and conserved state.** Open the actual last accepted state;
   apply exactly one permitted transition; close it with fresh randomness.
   Constrain integer ranges and overflow, refill frontiers, caps, all touched
   map paths and unchanged state. The balance changes only by `P`'s authorized
   refill, debit, settlement and any separately specified numerical adjustment.
   Pending outgoing **and incoming** obligations consume/reserve capacity in
   this same state. Replaying a period or dropping an archived obligation cannot
   increase available capacity. Missing formulas mean the full circuit is not
   ready to freeze; they cannot be replaced by sender-only counters.

4. **Both reservations precede protected release.** S authorizes its outgoing
   obligation and R explicitly authorizes its incoming obligation for the same
   hidden pair/nonce and agreed bounds. An unsolicited preflight cannot debit R.
   Honest cmsg endpoints release the protected introduction only after verifying
   committed state evidence for both roles, privately bound to that introduction.
   One possible split is operator acceptance of each owner's state commitment,
   followed by a separate proof **to the peer** that the accepted state contains
   the expected reservation. That peer proof and the other owner's commitment
   must never be forwarded in a named operator update. This composition still
   needs an executable protocol and atomicity/recovery review.

5. **Exact receipt authority and event.** For current cmsg `ContactResolution`,
   reconstruct `cmsg.contact-resolution.v1` exactly: community, responder, peer,
   introduction nonce, kind, issued time, device key and hash of the embedded
   credential bytes. Verify strict Ed25519 and root/device/eligibility bindings,
   including validity at the signed time and required current authorization.
   Outgoing settlement requires the *counterpart* as responder and owner as peer;
   a recipient's own closure resolves its incoming decision, not the sender's
   self-cancellation. Refreshing an expired receipt is the same settlement event.
   An `Answered` declaration does not prove delivery or sincere engagement;
   incoming answer rewards require a defined authenticated peer acknowledgment
   or other explicitly selected protocol event, not the prover's assertion that
   its UI sent something. That additional evidence contract is unfinished.

6. **Unique pair, unique event.** Prove the same permanent pair in reservation,
   receipt, private history and settlement. Event markers bind owner, original
   introduction and settlement purpose; pair-history markers survive epochs,
   roles and devices. Keep them independent across owners. Prevent swapping
   direction or choosing another nonce from turning one encounter into repeated
   rewards. Whether a reopened pair can earn anything again remains policy work;
   a fresh nonce alone cannot authorize another lifetime first-pair reward.

7. **Recipient-owned restrictions.** Preserve both owners' authenticated block
   chains, latest accepted tips and exact consent fields. An active recipient
   block is not removed by sender cancellation. Configured expiry permits only
   a fresh initiative; old queued data stays invalid. A counterproposal with a
   changed role/nonce/policy is not consent. Clearing a transport restriction
   does not itself create budget credit or delete an unresolved obligation.

The ledger must atomically compare the previous commitment, consume markers,
save its successor and cache the exact accepted response. Device races have one
winner. A malicious operator can still censor or fork its view: preventing forks
requires an independently consistent checkpoint/log assumption or additional
witnessing, not just a valid proof. Proofs do not establish human uniqueness,
stop voluntary sharing of all owner secrets, or prove reading. Confidentiality
also requires common configurations, Tor, careful scheduling and trusted browser
code; low traffic and correlated named updates remain identifying metadata.

The [durable reservation/recovery protocol](private-reservation-protocol.md)
describes owner envelopes and peer-only evidence, their experimental implementation
and the remaining production and recovery limits.

## Can the directional blind-receipt experiment be repaired directly?

The [experiment](../experiments/directional-receipts/README.md) already demonstrates
real membership proofs, authorized named debits, blind receipts, atomic retry and
conditional MLS release. Its affirmative pooling cases deliberately succeed:
the hidden qualified prover can prepare a receipt naming another hidden owner.
Three colluders concentrate six directional receipts on one account.

Adding a signature around that blind request does not prove equality between
the membership witness and hidden receipt owner. Proving that the sender debited
*some* issuance and the receiver redeemed *some* receipt also does not prove
same-token/same-pair provenance. Revealing the blinded message's identities or
sharing a public correlation field repairs equality by disclosing the graph.

RFC 9474 supplies blind signatures, not predicates about hidden message fields.
Retain the real transactional/release scaffolding, but the missing equality,
ownership, pair uniqueness and state-transition proofs require a richer proof
relation or different credential protocol. The experiment cannot become full
reciprocal accounting through field validation alone. [RSA blind signatures](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9474.html)

## Reuse routes and evidence

| Route | Concrete reuse and remaining work | Browser evidence for this accounting relation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anonymous credentials / proof-friendly signatures | Blind BBS credentials can hide holder attributes; Dock exposes Rust/Wasm signatures, equality/composite proofs and range checks. A circuit-friendly delegated accounting key could instead use Noir's BabyJubJub EdDSA and Merkle libraries. Both still need the complete owner/state/pair relation and root-authorized enrollment. | **Unmeasured.** Dock documents browser tests; its listed BBS+ encoding is `368 + 32 × hidden_messages` bytes, not a measurement of a composite accounting proof. No target-browser accounting time, memory or proof size is established. |
| Circuit verification of existing Ed25519 objects | Preserves current receipt authority/encoding. Must constrain SHA-512, strict Ed25519, canonical JSON/base64, credential hashes, root derivation and all state logic. No suitable maintained full verifier was selected in this review. Noir's library called `eddsa` uses BabyJubJub, **not Ed25519**. | **Unmeasured** for these objects. The benchmark below concerns another curve and cannot justify a cmsg estimate. |
| zkVM executing the existing Rust verifier | RISC Zero proves Rust guest execution, making reuse of parsing and verification semantics attractive; guest compatibility, cycle/memory cost and genuine zero-knowledge settings still need checking. Never upload private witnesses to a remote prover. | **Unmeasured.** Current RISC Zero docs recommend at least 16 GB for local proving. Native/GPU datasheets and browser verification do not establish browser proof generation. |

Primary implementation/specification sources: [Dock Rust/Wasm](https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm),
[blind BBS draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-blind-signatures),
[actual Noir EdDSA source](https://github.com/noir-lang/eddsa/blob/master/src/lib.nr),
[RISC Zero execution and hardware guidance](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/).
Blind BBS's modular committed disclosures are useful building blocks; the draft
explicitly leaves further range/pseudonym extensions outside its scope.

There is relevant **actual browser** evidence, with narrow limits: Hyli's
2025-03-20 P-256 benchmark reports UltraHonk proving at 2.06 seconds on an M1
MacBook, about 6 seconds on a Galaxy A23, and out-of-memory on tested iPhones.
The article supplies no proof-byte measurement for our relation. These are
historical results for one P-256 verification, not Ed25519, complete accounting,
current versions or all-platform suitability. [Benchmark authors' report](https://blog.hyli.org/benchmarking-in-browser-p256-ecdsa-proving-systems/)

Barretenberg supplies a real browser prover/verifier and documented thread/memory
controls. Its deployment documentation alone is not a benchmark or an audit of
our constraints. Pin the exact compiler/backend pair, zero-knowledge mode,
setup parameters and verifier; review transitive licensing before adoption.
[Browser API](https://barretenberg.aztec.network/docs/how_to_guides/on-the-browser/)

## Historical executable spike and subsequent work

The [isolated executable spike](../experiments/private-accounting/README.md)
uses Noir's built-in P-256 verifier and browser WebCrypto signing, with a real
Ed25519-verified root/device enrollment bridge. Crow **9/37** passed at source
`310bd23086f0978b5ffe3f7492dcb28e30786eb9`: 40 browser checks and 19 independent
verifier checks. Follow-up **9/38**, source
`36fc44b427a3cf7702d30d45fd0cc9aa212c5f25`, passed 41+19 with the same relation,
one selected binary and a pinned verifier key. Its two 14,656-byte binary proofs
took 18.20 and 17.28 seconds to generate in desktop Chromium with one prover
thread; verification took 38.07 and 32.10 milliseconds. Public inputs/JSON are
additional bytes. The circuit contains 200,214 gates; loaded bytes were 41.85 MB.
Sampled browser-family PSS reached **1,011,635,200 bytes (964.8 MiB)**, excluding
the native fixture and Node verifier. Of 219 samples, 217 were complete and two
missed exiting/unreadable processes; maximum sample gap was 200.54 ms. This is
an incomplete process-memory estimate, not exact peak WASM allocation. Mobile
performance remains unmeasured. Neither the 2 GiB ceiling nor the 65 MB end JS
heap sample describes actual peak memory. This result warrants optimization
before mobile suitability can be accepted.

That earlier spike proved only settlement of one synthetic, already-reserved obligation.
It tests root-owned delegated authority and hidden owner/receipt equality,
including genuinely signed wrong-signer, wrong-owner and backdated receipts.
The replay fixture uses one synchronous in-memory state comparison; it does
not demonstrate distributed concurrency. The two proofs use different events;
a separate hash comparison covers same-nonce markers under opposite owners.
The batched synthetic report provides no traffic-correlation evidence.
The explicit delegated-key extension does not verify unchanged cmsg Ed25519
receipts, and production `resolve_private` remains unsupported.

The following were the next checks after that spike. The later account-state
implementation now covers durable genesis, reservations, concurrency, delegated
authority and peer/release composition; follow the [current evidence](account-ledger.md)
for their exact source pins. Target-device resource suitability and production
activation remain separate:

1. Extend the measured commitment comparison below with target-browser resource
   measurements. Continue separating sampled process memory from linear WASM
   allocation; no all-platform feasibility claim is established.

2. Replace the synthetic pre-reserved starting state with one root-owned,
   durable genesis and an authorized reservation transition. Test recovery and
   independent competing successors. Keep the public policy explicit and
   reject unspecified parameters; do not choose product balances or deadlines.
   At that stage, dual reservation/private peer acknowledgment, concurrent
   pending maps and historical eligibility/block provenance were still missing.

3. Bind the versioned delegated receipt authority in cmsg itself, preserving
   exact member/pair/nonce/group/role semantics. Inspect both named operator
   envelopes for shared identifiers. Keep production admission fail-closed
   until the full relation, release/recovery composition and adversarial
   integration tests exist.

If browser resources are unsuitable, measure the unchanged-Ed25519/zkVM route
separately; never remove owner binding or upload a private witness to make a
benchmark pass. Those initial comparisons alone did not constitute the full backend.

### Measured commitment comparison

The [artifact-only profiler](../experiments/private-accounting/profile.mjs)
passed on Crow 9/39: SHA-256 source accounts for 152,608 gates (76.2%) and P-256
for 43,103 of the existing 200,214. This is source attribution, not isolated
primitive timing or a proportional memory forecast.

A separately versioned comparison keeps the exact SHA-256/WebCrypto P-256
receipt and root-owned Ed25519 delegation while using the maintained
[Noir Poseidon2 fixed-length hash](https://github.com/noir-lang/poseidon/blob/f249446e6e01f7b607ad35351cebe0cc20068cb7/src/poseidon2.nr)
for commitments and Merkle nodes. It reuses the upstream sponge, pins field,
arity and domains, and represents each 256-bit identifier with two checked
128-bit limbs. All equality/range/role/time constraints remain.

The independent verifier derives its root from the original Rust-verified signed
enrollments using the pinned [BB hash](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/v5.0.0/barretenberg/cpp/src/barretenberg/crypto/poseidon2/poseidon2.hpp).
Rust supplies verified original entries, not a Poseidon2 root. The delegation
binds the scheme; real browser proofs test cross-language agreement and reject
a genuinely re-signed field-congruent nonce retaining the old state/marker.

Crow **9/40**, source `d44c9f1e33f903a8e9a4bfea2a54ea82e9652521`, passed
**51 browser +20 independent checks**: 75,771 gates, padded to 131,072; two
14,656-byte proofs; proving 14.28/13.40 seconds; pinned-key verification
154.70/294.07 ms. Loaded bytes were 42.00 MB. Sampled PSS reached
**779,798,528 bytes (743.7 MiB)**, but only 184 of 214 samples were complete
and the maximum gap was 718.48 ms. Exact peak WASM memory remains unknown.
Same-source SHA **9/41** passed 42+20: proving 18.42/17.77 seconds, verification
40.66/33.13 ms, sampled PSS 959.7 MiB (205/229 complete; maximum gap 200.96 ms).
These shared-host runs establish compatibility, not stable performance gains or
mobile suitability. The unchanged setup floor remains 524,288 points.
This namespace change is not a migration
path for existing states/markers, and the composition has no audit claim.


The [durable SQLite experiment](../experiments/private-accounting/ledger.md)
passed Crow 9/42 at `0ef6fb410ad356ff483be49b7da45da3be9ed623`: 37 storage
checks within 54 independent-process checks, alongside 51 browser checks.
Actual verified statements drive retry, rollback, lost-response and competing
process tests. Genesis remains synthetic; versions and immutable checkpoint
scope are storage guards, not a complete private account relation. The same
circuit measured 7.32/7.05-second proving and 941.0 MiB sampled browser PSS in
this run, illustrating substantial run-to-run resource variation. Full private
accounting remains disabled.
